## Problem Statement
There is a lack of a culturally sensitive and multimedia-dominant accessible computer application to bridge the technology gap between affluent and impoverished populations, particularly those residing in rural areas with limited literacy.

## Vision
Our vision is to enhance the accessibility of health services by leveraging technology and AI. To achieve this, we aim to broaden the reach of our resources by incorporating multiple languages. Additionally, we prioritize the integration of speech-to-text technologies as a key aspect of future applications, allowing individuals with limited literacy and disabilities to access and benefit from the same health-focused application as others
